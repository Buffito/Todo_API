# ToDo API

A simple **internal task management tool** designed for team use within a Windows-authenticated environment.  
Built to track both **personal** and **shared ("bucket")** todos, with full history tracking and future plans for real-time updates. It's a work in progress.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Windows Authentication (no manual login required)
- [ ] Personal todos (visible only to the creator)
- [ ] Bucket todos (shared tasks assignable between users)
- [ ] Nested subtasks (each todo can have its own tree of steps)
- [ ] Completion cascade (when all subtasks are done, the parent completes automatically)
- [ ] Full action history per todo
- [ ] Basic filtering and search
